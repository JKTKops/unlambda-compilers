# Tests that `cd => `d<cont> behaves correctly (that is; like `ci)
# by considering the simple ``cir program. This program evaluates as
#   ``cir
#   `<cont>r
#   `rr
#   r [and printed newline]
# Similarly;
#   ``cdr
#   ``d<cont>r
#   `<cont>r
#   `rr
#   r [and printed newline]
# For clarity, we're using a function that prints "yay!" instead of r.
# That function is `d```.y.a.y.!, which becomes ````.y.a.y.!X when
# supplied an argument X, and otherwise does not print anything.

``cd`d```.y.a.y.!
